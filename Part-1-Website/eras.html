        On May 28, 2023, I attended Taylor Swift's Eras Tour at MetLife Stadium in 
        East Rutherford, NJ! I went with my sister, two of my friends, one of my 
        friend's friends, and my friend's mom. It was SO much fun, and we still 
        talk about the show and how much we loved it and how much we miss 
        it to this day. I remember we were all texting to figure out our outfits. 
        Each of Taylor's albums is considered one of her eras, so everyone chose
        a different era to go by. I went as Midnights! My sister went as 1989,
        my friend went as reputation, one of my friends went as 1989, my friend's
        friend went as Lover, and my friend's mom went as Red. It was so fun 
        getting ready together, especially since we had all slept over. It took 
        us a while to find parking, but we got a spot! Once we got there, we saw 
        everyone handing out friendship bracelets (ode to You're on Your Own, Kid, 
        one of my favorite Taylor songs!) and some girls gave us bracelets which were 
        SO cute! Our surprise songs were Welcome to New York and Clean, which are both 
        from 1989. At first, I didn't want Welcome to New York as a surprise song, 
        but then I thought, "who else can say they sang Welcome to New York with 
        Taylor at METLIFE STADIUM during the Eras Tour?" Then we went WILD when 
        she announced she was singing Clean! Afterwards, we slept over at my friend's 
        house and stayed up until 2am. I wish I could see the show again, but I'm so 
        blessed and forever grateful that I was able to even go to one show!
