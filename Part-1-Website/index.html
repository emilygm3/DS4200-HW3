    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'" id = 'home'> Hi! My name is Emily. I'm a second-year college student in Boston. 
        Some of my interests include listening to music and baking! 
        In this blog, I hope to share some more about my musical interests. 
        I've been singing my whole life, but I didn't start taking lessons 
        until I was in seventh grade. My favorite singers at the moment are 
        Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Noah Kahan, Tate McRae, and The 1975, 
        and I've also been listening to flipturn since my friend and I are seeing 
        their concert soon! We went to their concert last year, and I didn't know 
        any of their songs. Now, I am hooked on their music! My favorite Taylor 
        song is always changing, but Timeless and the 10 minute version of All Too 
        Well always hit hard. My favorite Sabrina song is We'll Be The Stars 
        since it brings back childhood memories for me. My favorite Noah song 
        is Messâ€”I especially love the lyric "and I'll take 89 to Boston." It 
        definitely hits home since I live in Boston now! My favorite Tate song 
        right now has to be messier. I've seen Taylor in concert twice, and I 
        really hope to see Sabrina, Noah, and Tate some day! Even though I don't 
        take voice lessons anymore, I still sing a lot. I was in choir from 5th-9th 
        grade, and I played clarinet for nine years from 4th to 12th grade. I was 
        in my high school's marching band and am now in my college's pep band, 
        which have both been amazing experiences!
